# React File Manager
An open-source React package for easy integration of a file manager into applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing files and folders, including viewing, uploading, and deleting, with full UI and backend integration.

This project is forked from [this fantastic project](https://github.com/Saifullah-dev/react-file-manager).

And our source code project is [here](https://github.com/jfvilas/react-file-manager).

## ‚ú® Features

- **File & Folder Management**: View, upload, download, delete, copy, move, create, and rename files
  or folders seamlessly.
- **Grid & List View**: Switch between grid and list views to browse files in your preferred layout.
- **Navigation**: Use the breadcrumb trail and sidebar navigation pane for quick directory
  traversal.
- **Toolbar & Context Menu**: Access all common actions (upload, download, delete, copy, move,
  rename, etc.) via the toolbar or right-click for the same options in the context menu.
- **Multi-Selection**: Select multiple files and folders at once to perform bulk actions like
  delete, copy, move, or download.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quickly perform file operations like copy, paste, delete, and more using
  intuitive keyboard shortcuts.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Move selected files and folders by dragging them to the desired directory,
  making file organization effortless.
- **Context cutomization**: Add your specifcia use-case icons and actions for your unique object types.

## üöÄ Installation

To install `React File Manager`, use the following command:

```bash
npm i @jfvilas/react-file-manager
```

## üíª Usage

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to use the File Manager Component in your React application:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { FileManager } from "@jfvilas/react-file-manager";
import "@jfvilas/react-file-manager/dist/style.css";

function App() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState([
    {
      name: "Documents",
      isDirectory: true, // Folder
      path: "/Documents", // Located in Root directory
      updatedAt: "2024-09-09T10:30:00Z", // Last updated time
    },
    {
      name: "Pictures",
      isDirectory: true,
      path: "/Pictures", // Located in Root directory as well
      updatedAt: "2024-09-09T11:00:00Z",
    },
    {
      name: "Pic.png",
      isDirectory: false, // File
      path: "/Pictures/Pic.png", // Located inside the "Pictures" folder
      updatedAt: "2024-09-08T16:45:00Z",
      size: 2048, // File size in bytes (example: 2 KB)
    },
  ]);

  return (
    <>
      <FileManager files={files} />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Typescript Usage
If you plan to user react-file-manager in a Typescript project, you can add type management by adding a `.d.ts` file. What follows is a sample file, but you can donwload a full module declaaration file **[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfvilas/react-file-manager/refs/heads/main/frontend/public/jfvilas-react-file-manager.d.ts)**. Inside that file you will find a module declaration and a bunch of type and interface declarations. What follows is just a excerpt.

```typescript
declare module '@jfvilas/react-file-manager' {
    export interface IFileData {
        name: string;
        isDirectory: boolean;
        path: string;
        updatedAt?: string;
        size?: number;
        class?: string;
    }

    export interface IError {
        type: string,
        message: string,
        response: {
            status: number,
            statusText: string,
            data: any,
        }
    }
...
```

In order to use this 'types' declaration file, just donwload and add it to your project inside your source folder (or any other folder and change your `package.json` accordingly).

## üìÇ File Structure
The `files` prop accepts an array of objects, where each object represents a file or folder. You can
customize the structure to meet your application needs. Each file or folder object follows the
structure detailed below:

```typescript
type File = {
  name: string;
  isDirectory: boolean;
  path: string;
  updatedAt?: string; // Optional: Last update timestamp in ISO 8601 format
  size?: number; // Optional: File size in bytes (only applicable for files)
  class?:string; // Optional: File class to be used with custom icons and custom actions
};
```

## üé¨ Icons & Actions
By adding your own icons and specific actions for your items, you can think of react-file-manager as just a hierarchical object manager, that is, this package is no longer just a file manager, you can, for example, create a hierarchy of books and implement particular actions. For example...:

 - You can have a top level category that consist of types of books: novel, essay, history...
 - On a second level you can add the topic: science-fiction, love, thriller...
 - On a third level you can just store the book title.

You can also add specific icons for each object (category, topic, book).

Moreover, you can add specific actions for each type of object:

  - For the top level, a sample action could be to show the list of books that belong to that category.
  - For the third level, the book in itself, you could add some actions like: read, view details, share link...

You can build interfaces like this: ![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfvilas/react-file-manager/refs/heads/main/frontend/public/fileman.png]

For achieving these objectives you need to add to each entry in the `files` object an **optional** property called `class`. So, for the top level, the class property could be `category`. For the second level, the value of `class` could be something like `topic`, and for the third level it could be something like `book`.

The next step is to add the icons for these objects. You must create a Map like this one:

```javascript
  let icons = new Map();
  icons.set('category', { open: <JSX.Element />, closed: <JSX.Element />, list: <JSX.Element />, grid: <JSX.Element /> })
  icons.set('topic', { default: <JSX.Element /> })
  icons.set('book', { open: <JSX.Element />, closed: <JSX.Element /> })
```

This way, when rendering an object with the `class` `category`, react-file-manager will show the proper icon, in the folder tree and also in the file list, wherever it be a grid or a list.

If you want to add specific actions for each `class`, you can, for example, create an `actions` map like this:

```javascript
  let actions = new Map();
  actions.set('book', [
    {
      title: 'Read book',
      icon: <FaRead />,
      onClick: (files) => {
        console.log('onclick view:', files)
      }
    },
    {
      title: 'Book details',
      icon: <FaBook />,
      onClick: (files) => {
        console.log('onclick delete:', files)
      }
    }
  ])
```

This previous piece of code adds two actions to objects of `class` `book`:

  - One for reading the book (the `onClick` method should open an ebook reader on screen).
  - Another one for viewing book details.

A typical action contains these properties (review the `.d.td` file):
  - `title`: the text to appear in context menus.
  - `icon`: the icon to show next to the text.
  - `onClick`: a function to process the action (one only parameter will be send: an array contianing the files which the action must be executed on).

Once you have defined your `icons` and your `actions`, you just need to add them to your FileManager object like this:

```xml
  <FileManager files={files} icons={icons} actions={actions} />
```

...And you'll see the magic ü™Ñ!!

What follows is an example with Kubernetes objects, icons and actions that we have implemented in (Kwirth)[https://www.github.com/jfvilas/kwirth] project.

## üé® UI Customization
`react-file-manager` can be easily customized to mmet your React application UI srtyles.

The simplest way for customizing this component is as follows:

  1. Create a `.css` file in your project directory (`custom-fm.css`, for example).
  2. Import it in the JSX or TSX file that contains your FileManager object: 
  ```javascript
  import './custom-fm.css'
  ```
  3. Customize your FileManager by adding classes to the `custom-fm.css` file. For example (please note we add our class name `custom-fm` on each style):
  ```css
  .custom-fm .toolbar {
    background-color: #e0e0e0;
    border-top-left-radius: 8px;
    border-top-right-radius: 8px;
  }

  .custom-fm .files-container {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  ```
  4. Add your class name to your `FileManager` object this way:
  ```xml
  <FileManager ... className='custom-fm'>
  ```

Et voil√† !

Provides JSON `response` holding uploaded file details, use it to extract the uploaded file details and add it to the `files` state e.g. `setFiles((prev) => [...prev, JSON.parse(response)]);` |
| `onFileUploading`        | (file: [File](#-file-structure), parentFolder: [File](#-file-structure)) => { [key: string]: any } | A callback function triggered during the file upload process. You can also return an object with key-value pairs that will be appended to the `FormData` along with the file being uploaded. The object can contain any number of valid properties. |
| `onLayoutChange`         | (layout: "list" \| "grid") => void | A callback function triggered when the layout of the file manager is changed. |
| `onPaste`                | (files: Array<[File](#-file-structure)>, destinationFolder: [File](#-file-structure), operationType: "copy" \| "move") => void  | A callback function triggered when when one or more files or folders are pasted into a new location.

| `permissions`            | { create?: boolean; upload?: boolean; move?: boolean; copy?: boolean; rename?: boolean; download?: boolean; delete?: boolean; } | An object that controls the availability of specific file management actions. Setting an action to `false` hides it from the toolbar, context menu, and any relevant UI. All actions default to `true` if not specified. This is useful for implementing role-based access control or restricting certain operations. Example: `{ create: false, delete: false }` disables folder creation and file deletion.                                                                                                                   |

| Refresh File List              | `F5`               |
| Clear Selection                | `Esc`              |

## üõ°Ô∏è Permissions

Control file management actions using the `permissions` prop (optional). Actions default to `true`
if not specified.

```jsx
<FileManager
  // Other props...
  permissions={{
    create: false, // Disable "Create Folder"
    delete: false, // Disable "Delete"
    download: true, // Enable "Download"
    copy: true,
    move: true,
    rename: true,
    upload: true,
  }}
/>
```

## </> Custom File Preview

The `FileManager` component allows you to provide a custom file preview by passing the
`filePreviewComponent` prop. This is an optional callback function that receives the selected file
as an argument and must return a valid React node, JSX element, or HTML.

### Usage Example

```jsx
const CustomImagePreviewer = ({ file }) => {
  return <img src={`${file.path}`} alt={file.name} />;
};

<FileManager
  // Other props...
  filePreviewComponent={(file) => <CustomImagePreviewer file={file} />}
/>;
```

## üß≠ Handling Current Path

By default, the file manager starts in the root directory (`""`). You can override this by passing
an `initialPath` prop. For example, to start in `/Documents`:

```jsx
<FileManager initialPath="/Documents" />
```

### Controlled usage with `currentPath`

If you want to **track and control** the current folder, you can pair `initialPath` with the
`onFolderChange` callback. A common pattern is to keep the path in React state:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [currentPath, setCurrentPath] = useState("/Documents");

  return (
    <FileManager
      // other props...
      initialPath={currentPath}
      onFolderChange={setCurrentPath}
    />
  );
}
```

### Important notes

- `initialPath` is applied **only once** when the `files` state is first set.
- After that, folder changes are driven by `onFolderChange`.
- If you want to keep the path in sync with user navigation, use a controlled state (as shown
  above).
